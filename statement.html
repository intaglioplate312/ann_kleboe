	<h4>Artist's Statment</h4>
    <div class="content_text">
      <p>I feel powerful when I use a pneumatic hammer on limestone, alabaster, or marble. I get a sense of rhythm and movement during the sounds of whacking at the stone. My desire to be unique can be realized in stone. </p>
<p>Have you seen and heard a worker with jackhammer breaking up concrete on sidewalks or streets? This is an intense amount of noise. Now see a mini jack hammer as a pneumatic hammer that gets its energy from an air compressor which fits under my basement stairs. </p>
<p>I protect my ears with earplugs and construction earmuffs too. Still I hear the noise and I move with rhythm which pulls me into a world of power. </p>
<p>A class at Adler Institute helped me understand how my artwork evolves in a process similar to the therapeutic process.  First, as a sculptor of stone, I work with the natural flaws in the stone as they occur.  </p>
<p>Hacking away at the stone without any conception of what it will be, I create chaos, unless it is already there.  Using the inherent flaws and my own errors in the stone as groundwork and as an integral part of the sculpture, I then begin to restore order, bringing out and enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses. I love depth and smooth travel arises with first with files then abrasive sand papers. </p>
<p>Yes, if you touch them you may want to own one. One time an observer at Old Town Art Fair was touching and moving her hands all over a sculpture, an art dealer Joyce Petter was watching then she asked me if I would show my work in her gallery in Saugatuck, Michigan. She sold a lot of my work from her gallery then called Prajna Gallery. The Art Institute of Chicago also sold my work in their Sales and Rental Gallery. </p>
